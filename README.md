### Description:
Capstone project using data wrangling and A/B testing analysis using a gym's membership database. This project requires me to see if the gym's A/B test on the chances of members signing up if they took a fitness test vs not taking one. I will have to access the data from a SQL database and then analyze the data for the A/B test. After, I need to display the data visually.

Python, SQL, pandas, numpy, chi2 contingency from scipy.stats, matplotlib
